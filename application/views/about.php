								Who's My Server is a startup company focused on providing services for dinners, servers and restaurants for
								day to day reservations. Our tool provides rating services for servers with exceptional value, which anables 
								restaurants and servers to improve on their services. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								We love  the connection that can happen when great food meets exceptional service. Who's My Server was founded 
								because we realized that each dinning experience is about more than food, It's about lasting memories, creating 
								connections and ultimately having a great time. We aspire to help restaurants improve on the service aspect of their 
								business while providing servers with a unique way to grow and achieve their full potential. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
								But that's just one phase. Our platform allows diners to gain control of their dinning experience. We give our dinners 
								the means to choose the server who gets to handle their food and make their dinning experience exceptional. with our platform, 
								the connection between a diner and a server starts before they get to the table.
								<br/>
								<br/>
								Very soon, our technically team will be releasing an android platform to make it easy for customers to reserve their server at their
								favorite restaurants. Our team of administrators and developers are working tirelessly to create a better platform and experience for customers, servers and restaurants 
								to manage reservations.	
								<br/>
								<br/>
								As we grow, we will continue build connections between diners and servers while proving our restaurants with vital tools they need to 
								enhance customer service and boost employee moral. We will provide educational tools, appreciation for great service and change a diners experience for the best. 
								We do what we do because we know that, you the diner , YOUR time is valuable and your dining experience deserves better than okay service, or leaving it to chance if
								you get great service. The next time you go out to dine, ask your self this question "WHo's MY Server".
